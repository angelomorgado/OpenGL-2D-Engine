# OpenGL 2D Engine
## By [Ã‚ngelo Morgado](https://github.com/angelomorgado)

This is a simple 2D engine written in C++ using OpenGL. It is intended to be used to do experiments with 2D graphics. Compatible with Windows and Linux.

### Instalation

On Linux:
    
```bash
sudo apt-get install mesa-common-dev libgl-dev libglfw3-dev libassimp-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev libxxf86vm-dev libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev libxext-dev libxrender-dev libglu1-mesa-dev
```

On Windows:

### Callbacks

This engine uses callbacks to handle input and update the scene. If the scene has its own callback function it can be defined in the scene class. However, if the scene uses the same callback as other scenes, the callback function must be defined in the Callbacks class in order to avoid code duplication and keep it organized.

To define mouse callbacks:
```cpp
// In the constructor of the scene
// Lock Mouse
glfwSetInputMode(window, GLFW_CURSOR, GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED); // In order to lock the mouse in the window (Optional)
glfwSetCursorPosCallback(window, Callbacks::mouse_callback_function);
```

To call the keyboard callback:
```cpp
// In the main loop
Callbacks::keyboard_callback_function(window); // If the callback is defined in the Callbacks class

// or 

keyboard_callback_function(); // If the callback is defined in the scene class
```
